						<h1>Vision</h1>
						<p>Tixy is a live event ticket platform that primarily allows users to purchase and sell their tickets with ease and transparency. With current ticket exchange applications, there is a lack of social functions for sharing events and verification, and the transparency of transactions is very limited. Tixy aims to fix that by bridging the gap between potential live event experiences and users.</p>


					</div>

					<div class="content-block">

						<h1>Challenges</h1>
						<p>- Create easy-to-understand data visualization</p>
						<p>- Explore live events seamlessly</p>
						<p>- Allow users to easily sell their tickets</p>
						<p>- Bridge the gap between users and sharing live events</p>

						<h1>Kickoff</h1>
						<p>Starting off there are a few initial questions. Who is our primary user? What kind of goals do they have? Why would someone want to use this application? How large of a scope do I want this project to be? After interviewing four participants to establish archetypes later on, it became evident that the goals they wanted to accomplish all fell within the same categories; have transparency of transactions when selling or buying their tickets, connecting with friends and other concert goes, and identifying more of the live events they like.</p>

						<h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
						<p>
							In order to construct a concise and solid foundation for Tixy, I had to research what the competitor ticket-buying applications were doing and what user goals they were not reaching. I evaluated several features deemed vital from user surveys and identified which ones Tixy could capitalize on to have a leg up over other applications.
							I found that the three main competitors did not offer user profiles or data visualization.
							Profile features were sparse in terms of personalize recommendations and being able to share events and visualize your data.</p>

						<h1>Evaluating the Activity</h1>
						<p>
							Just how popular are live events in general? According to IBIS, even during a pandemic there were still a huge market for ticket sales, and it has continued to grow back as we move forward.</p>

						<h1>Prioritization Plotting</h1>
						<p>			
							Plotting a list of the possible features onto a graph helped narrow down what was absolutely crucial for delivering the minimum viable product and would could be built upon further down the road. A big draw of using this application is to be able to share with others the events you attend, and exchanging tickets with ease. We can help users reach this goal by creating what is essentially a business card for each user, but for live events instead.

						<h1>In the end</h1>
						<p>Being a music lover, I found this project rewarding. I experimented with some of the new Adobe XD features, and narrow down my design process. I was not able to fully build out all features and designs I wanted to within Tixy but I am happy with the result. </p>
