                <h2>Project Vision</h2>

                <h3>I worked with <a href="https://www.learnitude.com/">Learnitude</a> and redesigned their central learning platform. I used their design system, did user research, made prototypes (Figma, Adobe Suite), and built mostly with vanilla javascript (and <a href="https://reactflow.dev/">react flow</a>).
                </h3>

                <h2>Overview</h2>


                <p>
                    Learnitude builds and provides corporate and government learning experiences. 
                </p>

                
                <p>
                    I worked with them on a government project. The goal was to create a quick reference tool that provides INL staff access to the Bureau’s resources and guidance on the best ways to utilize the resources in their work.
                </p>



                <h2>Wireframes</h2>

                <h2>Client Reviews</h2>

                <p>I played with various layouts, and explored concepts for navigation, exhibition views, and some loading interactions.</p>
                <p>I worked with a UI guide and the main thing I took away was balancing what I thought was efficient and client requests.</p>

                <h2>Final Designs</h2>

                <p>The final designs were well received, the overall result focused modernizing the existing platform navigation and removing unnecessary features.</p>
