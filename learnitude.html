                <h2>Project Vision</h2>

                <h3>I worked with <a href="https://learnitude.com">Learnitude</a> and redesigned their central learning platform. I used their design system, did user research, made prototypes (Figma, Adobe Suite), and built mostly with vanilla javascript (and <a href="https://reactflow.dev/">react flow</a>).
                </h3>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>2020 was strange. One trendy thing was everyone I knew started talking about crypto. I even had to elderly relatives asked me if they should buy doge coin. </p>
                <p>
                    Most people I know used Coinbase for its simplicity. Yet, when comparing it to other marketplace apps I noticed the randomness of the alert system, and its inability to be customized.</p>
                    <p>							
                        The alerts from Coinbase are sporadic and don't seem to follow a pattern. (Currently) If you look into the alert settings there is no option to customize anything beyond where the alerts are sent. The only customization is around where the alerts are sent.</p>

                <h2>Stay in the know</h2>

                <p>
                    Crypto is volatile. The people I interviewed would check frequently after purchasing a coin, since they did not know when specific price points would be reached as there is no alert system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coinbase generally would send out price alerts that would indicate a percentage change (increase or decrease) but none of it was customizable.
                    Another issue with the alert system is it would send alerts for any coin you favorited. It was not related to whether or not you are holding any of the coin, and the alerts that were sent seemed to be timed randomly.
                </p>



                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Coinbase could benefit from added features to its alert system. Being able to customize the alerts would make them useful.</p>
                <p>
                    Being able to set alerts for target price points (high or low) and percentages lost or gained is the minimum of what should be available.</p>
                <p>	
                    This is a personal project so nothing was ever implemented. I worked with coin base’s guidelines. I used Figma and Photoshop primarily to make the mockups and user flows.
