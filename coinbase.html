            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Graduating in May 2020 was strange. One odd thing was that everyone I knew started talking about crypto. I’ve even had to elderly relatives ask if they should buy dodge coin. Most people use Coinbase for its simplicity. Comparing it to other marketplaces I noticed the randomness of the alert system, and its inability to be customized.</p>
            
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p> This is a personal project so nothing was ever implemented. I did a bit of user research and worked with coin base’s <a class="inline__link" href="https://www.coinbase.com/press"targer="_blank">guidelines</a>. I used Figma and Photoshop primarily to make the mockup and user flow. </p>

            <h2>Stay in the know</h2>
            <p>Crypto is volatile. The people I interviewed would be compelled to check frequently after purchasing a coin, since they did not know when specific price points would be reached as there is no alert system. Coinbase generally would send out price alerts that would indicate a percentage change (increase or decrease) but none of it was customizable. </p>

            <p>Another issue with the alert system is it would send alerts for any coin you favorited. It was not related to whether or not you are holding any of the coin, and the alerts sent seemed to timed randomly.            </p>

            <h2>With Coinbase Alerts</h2>
            <p>You could now set alerts for coins at specific price points. This allows the user to know that each alert they receive is relevant to them. This in turn can provide a healthier interaction with the app since there would not be a barrage of notifications for irrelevant coins in an already volatile marketplace. The alerts are customizable and can be set to a different variables such as price highs and lows or percentage gained or lost.</p>

            <p>I had fun working on this project. It was good to utilize tools I learned in school, and practice Figma's prototyping feature. </p>
