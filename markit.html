        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p> Problem: It can be hard to find new dining experience, and worse to advertise a new dining experience. Worst of all is having to pick from all the options.<p>

            Solution: An app that holds information for dining events like pop ups, ghost kitchens, private dining, or catering, all in one place. Functions like a dating app with a right and left swiping feature, mixed with social networking capability.</p>
        
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <P>I have a few friends who do pop up events and work as private chefs and their main means of advertising is social media. This works to an extent, but it is easy to get drowned out by everything else. Tt’s hard to have all the information on a single profile when you are advertising through a medium not formatted for your business.</P>
        <p>The overall goal is is to design an app that is easy to understand and that supports discovery of new food events in the an area.</p>

        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p> This is a personal project so nothing was ever implemented. I worked with Figma, Photoshop, and Illustrator primarily.</p>

        <h2>Going Forward</h2>
    <p>Working on this project was fun. I wanted to see how quickly I could form an idea and implement a design. <br> If I were to go back it would be fun to build out the website as well, but I focused on the design aspect, not development.</p>
